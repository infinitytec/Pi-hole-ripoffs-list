# infinitytec's blocklists

## Ads and trackers
Ads and tracking hosts I have seen around the Internet. Some are rare. Some are popular.

[Hosts file format](https://github.com/infinitytec/blocklists/raw/master/ads-and-trackers.txt)

## Scams and phishing
Because they don't deserve your traffic. Blocked include financial schemes, imitation sites, malware, and people trying to take advantage of others through various things including fake news and misleading information.

This blocklist receives frequent updates.

## Adfilters
Adfilters in the format used by uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus. Has a lot of mobile ad rules as well.

Also receives frequent updates.

## Annoyances
Just some things (like cookie banners) I find annoying.

## Medical Pseudoscience
Blocks sites such as antivax sites and misleading medical information and "snake oil." Note that I am not a doctor; consult a medical professional for any medical advice. I also may have a few general conspiracy theory sites in there as well.

## Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)
This is in many ways a companion list to the Medical Pseudoscience list. Blocks MLM groups.

## Clickbait
Some sites only exist to spam content using clickbait. This helps reduce them.

## TikTok
Completely block TikTok. Based on multiple other blocklists with the same goal, but with many more added hosts.

## Possibilities
Domains that may be problematic. If anyone knows anything about these, please let me know. I do not recommend using this on a daily basis, as they may just break things.

# A note on formats:
Hosts format blocklists work with browser extensions such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and with DNS ad blockers such as [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).
Static filters work with uBlock Origin and similar adblockers.

# Do I have a false positive?
Please, create an issue to let me know, or [Contact me](https://infinitytec.github.io/contact/contact.html).

# Is your site on a list and you think it should not be?
Create an issue letting me know. If you make a good case for why I should remove it, I will remove it from the list.
You don't need to argue too hard about it though. I don't bite and want to remove as many false positives possible.

# A note on bias/selection criteria:
I try to look at possible misinformation sites from a objective and scientific point of view. Due to my beliefs I may not see eye-to-eye on some topic.
In an effort to maintain balance and not get too many people mad at me, I refrain from placing any mainstream media sites (including Fox and CNN for example) on any blocklists (I am still open to filtering ads and tracking from these sites still, including blocking domains and subdomains from them). Any news sites that are on my lists in entirety seem to me to be fringe and/or smaller sites that have good reason to be on them.
If you feel I have incorrectly blocked a site, please do let me know and I will look into it.
